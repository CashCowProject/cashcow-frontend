# Contributing to the Pancake ecosystem ðŸ¥ž

Thanks for taking the time to contribute !
You can start by reading our [Contribution guidelines](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/contributing) first.

## Setup

Create a `.env.development.local` file at the root of the project. Add the following lines inside :

```
REACT_APP_CROWDIN_APIKEY = ""
REACT_APP_CROWDIN_PROJECTID = ""
```

You'll need this in order to get the i18n system to work. Contact a dev if you need these values.

Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```

Don't forget to setup your IDE with `eslint` and `prettier`.

## Projet structure

- **components** contains generic components used inside the application.
- **views** contains building blocks for each page. The entry point of a view is used as the root component of each route.
- **config** contains all the config files and ABIs.
- **state** contains the redux files for the global state of the app.
- **context** contains global contexts (separated from the redux store)
- **hooks** contains generic hooks.
- **utils** contains generic utilities functions.

## Tests

Run tests with `yarn test`.

## Localisation

_In order for the Crowdin API queries to work - you will need `REACT_APP_CROWDIN_APIKEY` & `REACT_APP_CROWDIN_PROJECTID` env variables set in your root `.env.development.local` file_

### Adding translations

A hook expose the function you need to translate content.

```
import useI18n from 'hooks/useI18n'
...
const TranslateString = useI18n()
...
TranslateString(id, 'fallback')
```

- **id** is the crowdin id of the string you want to translate.
- **fallback** is a string fallback used if the id cannot be found.

### Variables

The translation component can handle variables being passed in from Crowdin, with no code changes.

It will only work if there is only **one** variable passed in, and if that variable within Crowdin is wrapped in **%** signs, i.e.:
